                I began to have an interest in learning Japanese when I had first realized I was
                gated off to content that I found interesting. I enjoyed a bunch of japanese media
                such as manga and video games, there are a ton of japanese content that never gets 
                translated or ported over or even talked about in the united states where I lived 
                so I took it upon myself to start learning japanese on my own.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the beginning I tried to enroll in classes but there was no classes offering 
                japanese around me beyond a university where id have to enroll for 4yrs minimum 
                in a field I did not plan to have a career in. It was hard to come to terms with 
                but there was no one who would get me started in learning that is reasonable,
                my options were transfers universities for a single class, move to japan as an english
                teacher or start learning on my own. So obviously there was only one choice.
            </p>

            <p>
                I started with learning the basics, hiragana and katakana. As most english speakers 
                who try to learn japanese on their own I wanted to make it as easy as possible looking
                up alphabet songs in japanese to get all the letters down but that doesnt exist considering
                to learn japanese you have to learn a new way of thinking and that kind of thing doesnt work
                in the japanese language as it does in english. I started off writing and speaking all the 
                characters every day and using a website called <a href="https://realkana.com/">realkana</a> to learn the basic
                characters.
